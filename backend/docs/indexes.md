# Database Indexing Strategy

## Overview

This document details the indexes created within our project's database collections and their intended use.

## Users Collection

### Username Index
- **Type**: Unique Index
- **Purpose**: 
  - Ensures uniqueness of `username` across the `Users` collection.
  - Enhances performance for operations involving user identification and authentication.
  - Critical for features like user registration and login.

### Email Index
- **Type**: Unique Index
- **Purpose**: 
  - Guarantees that each `email` is unique within the `Users` collection.
  - Improves efficiency of user retrieval by email, particularly useful for account recovery and communication.

## Tasks Collection

### User Reference Index
- **Type**: Standard Index
- **Purpose**: 
  - Improves the efficiency for fast retrieval and filtering of tasks associated with specific users.

## Pomodoro Sessions Collection

### User Reference Index
- **Type**: Standard Index
- **Purpose**: 
  - Improves the efficiency of queries that retrieve Pomodoro sessions associated with specific users.

## Future Strategies
- As our application evolves, we may introduce additional indexes or modify existing ones to align with new features or performance requirements.
- Compound and partial indexes will be considered for more complex query requirements or specific use cases.
